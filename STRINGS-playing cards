Playing Cards

PrepBuddy is playing a card game for the first time and needs your help. Let us tell you rules of this card game. In a pack of 
52cards, each card has a suit (
Diamonds — D, Clubs —C, Spades — S, or Hearts — H)
 and a rank (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J, Q, K,or A). At the start of the game, there is one card on the table and all 
 the players have five cards in their hand. A player can play
a card from her/his hand if and only if it has the same rank or the same suit as the card on the table.
It is PrepBuddy's turn, there is a card on the table and five cards in her hand. Can you find out if she can play atleast one card?

Input
First line contains an integer 
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines.

Second line denotes five cards in the hands of the player.
Each card is denoted by rank and suit. For example, 
2H- 
2
 is rank and 
H
 is suit.

Output
For each test case on a new line, print YES or NO depending on the above mentioned condition.
